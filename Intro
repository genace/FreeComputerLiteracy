In June of 2015, I founded an educational charity and named it as FREE COMPUTER LITERACY TO POOR CHILDREN, with the help of local donors. The main objective of this charity project is to give good quality informal computer education for FREE to poor children. It is mainly offered to the children of poor families. It is open to all for as long as that a child belongs to the poor family regardless of skin color, religious and political affiliations. Funded by good Samaritans who never expect something in return, this project is managed, run, administered by me together with my wife Liezel, a public school teacher. A few local volunteers, who are also knowledgeable in Linux, contribute to our effort. My children also help in running this project for they have experience in Linux environment since they were exposed to Linux when they were still young. At home and at work, we use Linux applications daily. Open Source is my ‘official’ partner and the main instructional standard. That means all modules should be taught in Linux. 
This project has three major impacts to our students:
  1) If these kids can’t afford a college degree when they grow up, their learning can be used as their best qualification for local job opportunity,
  2) If they can pursue college education it’s their best preparation.
  3) If they can secure a capital they can start their own business for they enough skills to run it.

I want them to be self-sufficient in terms of computer skills. In Philippines poverty is the biggest problem. It’s my dream that through this project these poor kids can have a fair chance of attaining a better future. It sounds great and amazing, and it’s a rare project that many people has got interested in it. I started with just two personal computers teaching the poor kids with different modules such as basic typing (Word processing and spreadsheets), graphics design, audio/video editing, animations, troubleshooting, and program coding.
